<p>I’ve had the idea of starting a blog for a long time. I’ve thought about the reasons why I haven’t done it, and there are mainly two: one is that I’ve been too busy, and the other is that I’ve constantly worried about not having the energy to maintain it. I think the second reason might be the biggest matter, and it’s been a long-standing issue for me – often being too much of a perfectionist. It’s not that perfectionism is bad, but it’s important to choose the right approach in the right circumstances – deciding whether to pursue perfection or opt for rapid iteration based on task priorities and schedules. Waiting until everything is perfect and polished before starting or launching a product can be the right attitude in some cases, a good thing, but in others, it can be a constant hindrance.</p>
<p>In the past, I loved writing articles. Late at night, with a solitary lamp casting shadows, I’d write not for others to see but just for myself. Sometimes, I’d get inspired by a news story or an editorial, and I’d start writing. No fixed structure, no predetermined content, no specific theme – I’d just put pen to paper. As I wrote, it became a conversation with myself, a way to express the thoughts I wanted to convey and solidify my convictions through writing.</p>
<p>In the past, I had a literary flair, and I loved to read. I read 屈原 and 司马迁, 海明威 and 莫言, and often 韩寒, 江南, and 九把刀. Of course, I also read a lot of online novels. I would often hide under my blanket at midnight, sneakily using an old smartphone to read, only to be scolded by my parents and have the phone taken away. But there were plenty of old phones at home, so I found ways to sneak them back and continue reading.</p>
<p>Now, I feel so distant from the person I used to be. Since entering college, life has become faster-paced, and there are more things to consider. I have less time to read books and less time to put pen to paper. Even when I do find some free time to read, it’s usually books related to products and business – more utilitarian, with different goals in mind. Even when I write articles, they are no longer reflective, introspective essays. Writing this type of article is more often a way of solidifying one’s own ideas. After I stopped writing this kind of article, I began to feel that my thoughts weren’t as firm, and I was more easily swayed by the crowd, going with the flow.</p>
<p>I want to try to rediscover that person I used to be.</p>
<p>So in the future, I will write here casually, jotting down what I want to say and my daily thoughts in words. It’s a way to crystallize my methodology, a place where I can come back often to reflect on my own words. It’s also convenient – there’s a link that I can access and shareanytime, anywhere, and it’s public, making it easy for others to provide guidance and insights.</p></div><div class="tab-pane" id="tabs_1-2"><p>看到这篇文章的人们，你们好。</p>
<p>有一个博客的想法很久了。一直没有做的原因我想了一下，大概主要是两个：一个是太忙了，一个是感觉一直在担心，担心没有精力维护。我觉得第二个原因可能才是最大的罪魁祸首，这也是我长期以来的一个毛病，很多时候太过完美主义。不是说完美主义不好，而是应该在合适的场景下，选择合适的主义——根据任务优先级和排期选择合适的策略，是完美主义还是快速迭代？不准备好不开始，不打磨到完美无缺不推出产品，这些在有些情况下是正确的态度，是好事，但在有些情况下会不断拖后腿，变成坏事。</p>
<p>以前的我，是很爱写文章的。深夜，孤灯与人影相映。不给别人看，只给自己看。有时候就因为看到了一个什么社会新闻或者社论，青年人的一股劲就上来了。不定框架，不定内容，不定主题，提笔就写。写到后来，就变成了和自己对话，把想要说的话通过写的方式一吐为快，把想要坚定的想法落成文字强化心智。</p>
<p>以前的我，有文气，爱读书。会读屈原司马迁，会读海明威，会读莫言老舍周国平，更多时候是在读韩寒、江南、九把刀，当然了，最多的还是一众网络小说。我常常半夜躲在被子里，偷拿家里的旧手机看，然后被家长发现批评一顿，把旧手机收走。但是家里旧手机多，我就想办法搞过来，继续接着看。</p>
<p>现在的我，离以前的我，好遥远。上大学以后，节奏更快了，总是被各种事情推着走，想想花时间做这些事情似乎不值。看书的时间少了，落笔写文的时间少了。就算偶尔有空看书，我也是看的产品、商业有关的书籍，比较功利，目的已经变了。就算写文章，也不会是反省自我、记录思考的散文了。写下这种文章更多时候是在坚定自己的想法。其实不再写这种文章后，我尝尝感到自己思想就不够坚定，很容易从众，随波逐流。</p>
<p>我想尝试找回这些过去的我。</p>
<p>所以未来，我就会在这里随便写写，把想说的话、日常的思考用文字写下来，沉淀方法论，常常回来自己看。这样也比较方便，有个链接在随时随地都能看到和分享，也是公域流量，方便大家指点迷津。</p></div></div></div>
